## 🧰 What Is the SoT Mod Menu?

No need to inject separate scripts or guess which hack’s working — it's all unified, clean, and customizable.

## 🚀 How to Launch the Mod Menu

1. **Turn off antivirus and overlays**
2. Run your trusted **cheat loader or injector**
3. Open Sea of Thieves
4. Inject once you're at the **main menu or in-game lobby**
5. Hit the hotkey (usually `Insert` or `F12`) to open the menu
6. Toggle cheats on/off with checkboxes, sliders, and binds
7. Save config profiles for different playstyles

Most menus also include **“stealth mode”** — so the UI doesn’t show if someone’s watching your screen.

## 🧠 Extra Tips for Smart Use

* Use *ESP only when necessary* — don’t get reported for "magical awareness"
* Adjust radar range to avoid looking suspicious
* Avoid rage settings on aimbot in public PvP
* Save configs for vault runs, skeleton forts, or Reaper PvP
* Update your menu every time Sea of Thieves patches — always stay compatible

## ⚠️ Safety & Ban Risk

Mod menus with private loaders are more stable and safer than random public scripts. Still, here’s how to reduce heat:

* 🛑 Avoid showing mod menu on stream
* 🛑 Don’t toggle god mode near big crews
* 🛑 Use private sessions to test new features
* 🛑 Never inject during cutscenes or matchmaking screens

Used smartly, mod menus fly under the radar — just don’t get cocky.
